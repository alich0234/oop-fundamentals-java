![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-latest%20release-blue)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the **oop-fundamentals-java** project! This project provides code snippets and mini-projects to help you understand and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. Whether you're starting from scratch or brushing up on your skills, this guide will walk you through the process of downloading and running the application.

## üì¶ System Requirements

To use this application, you need:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher installed on your computer. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).
- **Operating System**: This project works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üîó Download & Install

To get started, visit the releases page to download the latest version of the `oop-fundamentals-java` application. 

[Visit Releases Page to Download](https://github.com/alich0234/oop-fundamentals-java/releases)

Once you are on the releases page, look for the latest release and download the file suitable for your operating system. This file will be in `.zip` format.

1. Click on the latest version.
2. Find the `.zip` file listed under assets.
3. Click on the file to download it to your computer.

## üìÇ Extract the Files

After downloading, you need to extract the files:

1. Locate the downloaded `.zip` file on your computer.
2. Right-click on the file and select "Extract All" or use a similar option depending on your system.
3. Choose a destination folder to extract the files. 

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run the Application

Once you have extracted the files, you can run the application:

1. Open the folder where you extracted the files.
2. Look for the `.java` files or the `main` class file.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt. 
4. Navigate to the directory where the files are located.
5. You can compile and run a specific Java file using the following commands:

   ```bash
   javac YourFileName.java
   java YourFileName
   ```

Replace `YourFileName` with the actual file name you wish to run.

## ‚ú® Explore the Code Snippets

Inside the folder, you will find various code snippets and mini-projects. Each project focuses on a different OOP principle. You can explore:

- **Abstraction**: Learn how to hide complex implementation details.
- **Encapsulation**: Understand how to bundle data with the methods that operate on it.
- **Inheritance**: See how one class can inherit from another.
- **Polymorphism**: Discover how methods can take many forms.
- **Method Overloading**: Check how you can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
- **Method Overriding**: Learn how to redefine a method in a subclass.

## üéì Learning Resources

To better understand OOP principles, consider exploring the following resources:

- [Oracle Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html): Official tutorials from Oracle.
- [Codecademy Java Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java): An interactive platform for learning Java.
- [Coursera Java OOP Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-object-oriented-programming): A comprehensive course focusing on OOP.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while downloading or running the application, here are some tips:

- **Java Not Recognized**: Make sure that you have installed the JDK and that it is added to your system's PATH variable.
- **Cannot Find File**: Double-check that you've extracted the files properly and are running the correct file in the terminal.
- **Error Messages**: If you see any error messages, read them carefully; they often indicate what went wrong.
